I developed an AI-based therapist application inspired by ELIZA, implemented in C++ with a graphical user interface (GUI) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program simulates a conversation with a therapist, providing automated responses based on user input, and offers a dynamic, interactive experience. The project involved designing conversational algorithms and integrating the GUI to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.
